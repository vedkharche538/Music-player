Tkinter is a library for creating GUI applications. Here we don’t need to use much functions of it we just need to use the askdirectory() method of Tkinter and other methods that you will see in the code section below.<br/>

Then we will create functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player. To create these commands, we’ll build some functions and we’ll use Tkinter to create the button in the interface.<br/>
